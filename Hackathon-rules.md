###Intellectual Property Rights

All submissions remain the intellectual property of the individuals or organizations that developed them.

###Protection of Intellectual Property

By submitting an Entry or accepting any prize, you represent and warrant the following: you will not submit content that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the content; and the content submitted by you does not contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms or other disabling devices or harmful code.

###Copyright

###Eligibility

Organizers of "IPFS Ethereum Hackathon" have the ability to determine whether an entrant is eligible for the Contest.
If an entrant does not follow the cited code of conduct or is found to be breaking copyright or is determined malicious in anyway
the entrant will be marked as disqualified and will not be included in the competition.

###WINNER SELECTION/JUDGING CRITERIA

The Contest winners will be selected by a panel of judges ("Judges").

By submitting any IPFS Ethereum Hackathon Entry, entrants release IPFS Ethereum Hackathon, Sponsors, their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, representatives, agents, and advisors from any and all liability for any claims, costs, injuries, losses, or damages of any kind arising out of or in connection with the decisions of the Judges.

###Friendly Harassment-Free Space
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.

*Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.*

Harassing other participants is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.
